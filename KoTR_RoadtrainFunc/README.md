# KoTR_RoadtrainFunc (29.12.2025)
King of the Road / Hard Truck 2 roadtrain movement plugin.

Function for processing the movement of road trains, copied from exe to the asi plugin. The coupling/disengagement of the semi-trailer with the tractor does not work correctly. To hitch, you need to press the "T" button (or another one selected in the game settings), and then call 911 (or restore the truck using cheats). Or rebuild the plugin by increasing the value of the couplerAttachDist parameter. The release does not work. Otherwise, everything corresponds to the original game.
