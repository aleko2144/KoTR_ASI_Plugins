## KoTR_ClassicRainGlassEffect (31.10.2025)
Version 0.01

A modification that transfers the effect of raindrops on glass from earlier versions of the game in 8.2 / 1.3.

Warning: the asi plugin does not change this, but the cabines.res file line "glass tex 2 noz att 1" must be set to "glass tex 2 noz".
